It enables you to define a contract that any function can fulfill, as long as it matches the signature. This can be a powerful way to decouple the implementation details from the code that uses those functions, leading to a system that's easier to manage and evolve.\n\nFor instance, you could have a delegate for data fetching that could be implemented using various data sources. During testing, you could pass in a mock function that returns controlled data, making your tests more reliable and quicker to run.\n\nHowever, there's a trade-off. This approach can make the code harder to trace since it's not always clear which function is being called. There's also a performance consideration, although in many cases the impact is negligible compared to the benefits gained.\n\nDocumentation and clear naming conventions become super important in a system that heavily uses delegates, to maintain readability and understandability. It's all about finding the right balance for your specific project needs.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"OK, I've heard enough.","role":"user"},{"content":"Understood, I'll leave it there.
