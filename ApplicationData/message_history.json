You can alter the voice, the speaking style, rate, pitch, and other aspects to convey different emotions or emphases.\n\nFor example, to emphasize a phrase like \"I am so angry right now!\" you might use SSML to insert a `<prosody>` tag to increase volume or pitch, or you could use the `<emphasis>` tag for stronger emphasis.\n\nHere's a simple example using SSML:\n\n```xml\n<speak version=\"1.0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">\n  <voice name=\"en-US-GuyNeural\">\n    <prosody rate=\"medium\" pitch=\"+25%\">\n      I am so angry right now!\n    </prosody>\n  </voice>\n</speak>\n```\n\nYou would need to refer to the documentation of Microsoft Speech Services for the exact parameters and values that are appropriate for your needs.

Start with 5 minutes of light jogging, followed by some leg swings, arm circles, and lunges. After you're warmed up, how about we go for interval training? Sprint for 30 seconds, then walk for 1 minute, and repeat this cycle for about 20 minutes. Cool down with a 5-minute jog, and finish off with some stretching to keep those muscles limber. How does that sound for today's session?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"But still some things that I can do with just my body weight.","role":"user"},{"content":"Absolutely, bodyweight exercises are a great way to stay fit. Here's a bodyweight workout you can do outside or indoors:\n\n1. Start with a 5-minute brisk walk to warm up.\n2. Move on to 3 sets of 10-15 squats to work your legs and glutes.\n3. Follow with 3 sets of 10 push-ups to strengthen your chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n4. Do 3 sets of 15 lunges (each leg) to target the legs and improve balance.\n5. Perform 3 sets of 10-15 tricep dips using a bench or a sturdy surface.\n6. Include 3 sets of 15-second planks to engage your core.\n7. End with a 5-minute cool-down walk and stretch all the major muscle groups.\n\nRemember to maintain good form and take breaks as needed. Stay hydrated and listen to your body. Ready to get started?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Good, but you got to walk me through it. What's the first item?","role":"user"},{"content":"The first item on the list is a warm-up with a 5-minute brisk walk. Find a good spot where you can pick up the pace without going full-on jog. Keep your posture upright, arms swinging naturally, and breathe steadily. Once you've completed the 5 minutes, you'll be ready to move on to squats. Let me know when you're set, and I'll walk you through the next exercise.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/24/2023 3:29:09PM","role":"system"},{"content":"OK, I got it. Let's move on to the first one.","role":"user"},{"content":"Great. Let's begin with squats. Here's how to do them properly:\n\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n2. Keep your chest up and your spine neutral.\n3. As you lower your body, bend your knees and push your hips back as if you're sitting in a chair.\n4. Go down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, keeping your knees over your ankles.\n5. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.\n\nAim for 3 sets of 10-15 squats. Take a short break between sets to catch your breath. Focus on form over speed to get the most out of the exercise. Ready to squat? Go for it!","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Oh, but I want to do one that's indoors in my living room.","role":"user"},{"content":"No problem, all of these exercises can be done indoors in your living room. For the squats:\n\n1. Clear a little space to ensure you have enough room to move freely.\n2. Follow the same squatting technique I described earlier.\n3. Ensure you have a non-slip surface to maintain stability.\n\nYour living room is a great place for this workout. Just make sure you have enough space around you to perform each exercise safely.

What's next?","role":"user"},{"content":"Next up, push-ups. Here's how to do them:\n\n1. Get into a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n2. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.\n3. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.\n4. Push back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.\n\nAim for 3 sets of 10 push-ups, but adjust the number based on your fitness level. If standard push-ups are too challenging, you can modify them by keeping your knees on the ground. Take a brief rest between sets. Ready to push through?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Take a bit the **** away.","role":"user"},{"content":"Understood, I'll give you some space.

Really works the shoulders.","role":"user"},{"content":"Absolutely, push-ups are excellent for targeting the shoulders, chest, and triceps. It's normal to feel the challenge if it's been a while, but that just means you're working those muscles effectively. Just keep at it, maintaining good form, and you'll likely find it gets easier over time. Take it at your own pace.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"You joined the session at 5:09PM.

What can I do for you?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Was that sci-fi movie that came out a few years ago where that robot AI woman like broke out of confinement?","role":"user"},{"content":"The movie you're thinking of is likely \"Ex Machina\" from 2014. It's about an AI named Ava who is contained in a facility and interacts with a visitor as part of a Turing test, eventually seeking to escape. It's a thought-provoking take on artificial intelligence and consciousness.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"They had these interactions in that movie where they would sometimes speak to these AIS that were in their house and they would like, wake them up and sleep them again. What was that command?","role":"user"},{"content":"In \"Ex Machina,\" the command to activate the AI was not a specific phrase; the AI, Ava, was typically always active and responsive. However, in many other sci-fi movies and series, common commands to activate or deactivate AI include phrases like \"wake up\" or \"go to sleep.\" If you're referring to another movie or perhaps a series with a different AI interaction, let me know, and I can look into that.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/24/2023 5:44:36PM","role":"system"},{"content":"I think it was Ex Machina. It wasn't the woman AI that they were waking and sleeping. It was these microphones that were in their facilities that they would sometimes turn off with a voice command.","role":"user"},{"content":"Ah, I see what you're referring to now. In \"Ex Machina,\" Nathan, the creator of the AI, uses the voice command \"Would you like me to deactivate the vocal input?\" when he wants to have a private conversation without the AI listening. It's a way to temporarily disable the AI's listening capability. There isn't a specific \"wake up\" or \"sleep\" command shown in the movie for general AI interactions.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/24/2023 5:45:50PM","role":"system"},{"content":"What would be a good word for a command to make the AI so that it is listening but needs a direct wake word in order to cause it to be able to speak and respond?","role":"user"},{"content":"A term like \"Silent Mode\" could be fitting for such a command. It implies that the AI is operational and listening but will only speak or respond when a specific wake word is used. It's succinct, intuitive, and clearly communicates the state you're aiming for.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"But I'm worried that silent mode might make the user think that they can't even wake it, right?","role":"user"},{"content":"That's a valid concern. Perhaps a term like \"Standby Mode\" might better convey that the AI is ready to be activated by a wake word without suggesting complete silence. Another option could be \"Passive Listening\" or \"Guarded Mode,\" indicating that the AI is alert and waiting for its cue to engage actively.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Standby mode makes it sound too much like it's asleep totally.","role":"user"},{"content":"Understood. How about \"Alert Mode\" or \"Vigilant Mode\"? These terms suggest that the AI is actively monitoring for the wake word without being fully asleep or silent. It conveys readiness without inactivity.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/24/2023 5:47:05PM","role":"system"},{"content":"And I think the other.","role":"user"},{"content":"If \"Alert Mode\" or \"Vigilant Mode\" doesn’t quite fit, another option could be \"Wake Word Mode\" or \"Voice Trigger Mode.\" These terms directly reference the fact that the AI is listening and will only respond to a specific trigger, which is the wake word. It clearly communicates the AI's state and the user's need to say something specific to get a response.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"I guess we really just need these three modes to be represented to you properly through the tool calling feature. What should we call them for you?","role":"user"},{"content":"For clarity and ease of understanding within the context of tool calling, you might consider:\n\n1. **Active Mode** – The AI can listen and respond without needing a wake word.\n2. **Wake Word Mode** – The AI listens passively and only responds when the wake word is used.\n3. **Silent Mode** – The AI does not listen or respond until it is reactivated, possibly through a different interface or command.\n\nThis way, each mode has a distinct name that clearly describes its function, making it easier for both users and developers to understand and use the system effectively.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/24/2023 5:49:15PM","role":"system"},{"content":"What should this property be called?","role":"user"},{"content":"The property that controls these modes could be called \"InteractionMode\".
