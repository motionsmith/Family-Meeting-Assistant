The second task is about terminating API requests when dictation is detected to prevent unnecessary responses from me.

When I make little pauses in speech like humans do, then it causes you to start responding again before I'm finished talking in the I'm in the middle of my sentence.","role":"user"},{"content":"And so if I make a pause, then I start again, then it'll cancel that request. That seems to be working better now.","role":"user"},{"content":"It's good to hear that the cancellation during speech pauses is functioning better.
