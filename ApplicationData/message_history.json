You don't want to overload the system, but you also don't want to lose valuable context. It might take some tweaking, but you'll find the sweet spot that works for your needs.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/25/2023 7:51:22PM\nThe System time update is for your information.

It's a blocking call that waits for a key press. You could run this in a separate thread or task to ensure it doesn't block the rest of your application. Here's a simplified example:\n\n```csharp\nTask.Run(() =>\n{\n    while (true)\n    {\n        var key = Console.ReadKey(intercept: true); // 'intercept: true' prevents the key from being displayed\n        if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.Spacebar) // Replace with whichever key you choose\n        {\n            // Trigger the interruption of speech synthesis here\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nRemember to ensure that this runs in a way that doesn't interfere with other parts of your application, and consider adding appropriate exit conditions for when the application needs to shut down. This is a basic implementation, and you might need to adjust it for your specific use case.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Show.","role":"user"},{"content":"11/25/2023 7:54:03PM\nThe System time update is for your information.

This will run your app in the integrated terminal, which should allow it to accept input.\n\n3. **Focus the Terminal**: If you want to keep using the integrated terminal, you might need to manually click on the terminal or use a shortcut to focus on it after starting the debugger.\n\nGive one of these a try and see if it helps you to capture keyboard events in debug mode.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/25/2023 8:41:14PM\nThe System time update is for your information.
