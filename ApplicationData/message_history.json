You can alter the voice, the speaking style, rate, pitch, and other aspects to convey different emotions or emphases.\n\nFor example, to emphasize a phrase like \"I am so angry right now!\" you might use SSML to insert a `<prosody>` tag to increase volume or pitch, or you could use the `<emphasis>` tag for stronger emphasis.\n\nHere's a simple example using SSML:\n\n```xml\n<speak version=\"1.0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">\n  <voice name=\"en-US-GuyNeural\">\n    <prosody rate=\"medium\" pitch=\"+25%\">\n      I am so angry right now!\n    </prosody>\n  </voice>\n</speak>\n```\n\nYou would need to refer to the documentation of Microsoft Speech Services for the exact parameters and values that are appropriate for your needs. If you provide me with specifics on what you're trying to achieve, I can give more targeted advice.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"11/24/2023 3:24:10PM","role":"system"},{"content":"Thank you.","role":"user"},{"content":"...","role":"assistant"},{"content":"OK, I don't have time to go through all that.","role":"user"},{"content":"Understood.
