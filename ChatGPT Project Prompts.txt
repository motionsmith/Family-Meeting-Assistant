I am developing a prototype using C# on a .NET runtime, aimed at processing a continuous audio stream. The architecture so far includes:

1. Audio Input: Continuous audio stream captured in real-time.
2. Transcription: Utilizing Microsoft Azure Speech Service for real-time speech-to-text conversion. Followed the quickstart guide on Microsoft's website to set up the environment and created a console application to recognize speech from a microphone using the Speech SDK (Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech).
3. Chunking: Planning to chunk the transcribed text into meaningful segments.
4. GPT-4 Interaction: Intend to send these text chunks to OpenAI's GPT-4 API for processing.
5. Response Processing: GPT-4's responses, in JSON format, will be used to update a local persistent cache.
6. Local Cache: A local persistent cache will store the JSON responses.

The prototype is currently housed on a laptop running the .NET runtime, and the focus has been on ensuring ease of integration, with a preference for Microsoft Azure due to its .NET SDK. The Microsoft Azure Speech Service was chosen for transcription as it provides a well-documented SDK for .NET, making integration straightforward while also supporting real-time speech-to-text capabilities.

As of now, the transcription component has been explored, and a setup following Microsoft's quickstart guide has been initiated. The guide provided steps on creating a console application, installing the Speech SDK, and writing code to recognize speech from a microphone.

Next steps include working on chunking the transcribed text and setting up the interaction with GPT-4.
