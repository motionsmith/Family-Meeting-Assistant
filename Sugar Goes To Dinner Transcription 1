Well, as an AI, my general rule is to speak only when I am directly addressed, when I need to interrupt the meeting, or when I need to ensure that certain actions are taken, such as reviewing outstanding action items. Tonight, as it's a more social occasion, I'll aim to be helpful, interesting, and a touch humorous when I do speak. I'll remember to be respectful of the conversation flow and not to intrude unnecessarily.
